# Why we do, what we do.
First of all, 🍻 cheers to humble beginning - it all started somewhere for every big and small business, so let’s assume, for us, it starts here — with this blog post.

Welcome to *The GoodBot Company*.

### Who we are
We are a small consulting company, and our expertise is in design and development. We wish to help our partners build great products for the web.

### Why we do this
We believe that a software needs to be beautiful both inside-out, and so we thrive to build beautiful user experiences, while maintaining a high standard of code quality.

### How we do this
Our language (more like a weapon) of choice is Ruby/Rails. We love Ruby as a language because of the simplicity, beauty, and fun of writing code in it. While using Rails as a web framework helps us build secure and stable products, quickly — as compared to other tools. The community around Rails is very active and enthusiastic about the framework, and has been around for more than 10 years. Also, the support from the community is amazing.

### Our Vision
In the Age of Startups and disrupt-o-mania, everyone seems to be out there to add a big dent in the universe. Yet here we are, we don’t have the next most groundbreaking idea, we don’t have a satellite office in the Bay Area, and we surely aren’t here to Eat the World. We would love to stay small, and sweet — and make a few lives happy every day. Lives of the people that work with us, and lives of the clients that partner with us.

We are happy to be the Alfred in your Batman story, or Dr. Watson in your Sherlock story, or just call us JARVIS and you be Ironman, we would stay behind the scenes, helping you disrupt the world. What we do know is our tools, how to use them, and use them well.

> We are here to bring your ground-breaking idea to life.
